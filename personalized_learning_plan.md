## Practice Problems

Key foundational topics for practice problems include:

- **Introduction to Pandas for Data Manipulation**

  - Problem 1: Import Pandas and create a DataFrame from a given dictionary containing stock price data for three companies over two days.
    Solution:
    1. Import Pandas: `import pandas as pd`.
    2. Create a dictionary: `data = {'Company': ['Company A', 'Company B', 'Company C'], 'Day 1': [100, 200, 300], 'Day 2': [120, 210, 290]}`.
    3. Create a DataFrame: `df = pd.DataFrame(data)`.
    4. Print the DataFrame.
       Answer:
    ```
    Company  Day 1  Day 2
    0    Company A    100    120
    1    Company B    200    210
    2    Company C    300    290
    ```
  - Problem 2: Select specific columns from the DataFrame and calculate the daily change in stock prices.
    Solution:
    1. Select 'Day 1' and 'Day 2' columns: `df[['Day 1', 'Day 2']]`.
    2. Calculate daily change: `df['Day 2'] - df['Day 1']`.
    3. Create a new column 'Daily Change' and assign the calculated values.
       Answer:
    ```
    Company  Day 1  Day 2  Daily Change
    0    Company A    100    120             20
    1    Company B    200    210             10

    3. Create a time series: `pd.Series(range(12), index=pd.date_range('1/1/2022', periods=12))`.
    4. Plot the time series: `plt.plot(ts)`.
       Answer: A plot of the time series from January 2022 to December 2022.

    3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    4. Create a LinearRegression model, fit it, and predict.
       Answer: Predicted stock prices based on the linear regression model.
  - Problem 2: Evaluate the performance of the linear regression model.
    Solution:
    1. Use metrics like MAE and MSE.
    2. Calculate these metrics.
